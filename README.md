# Alpine.JS components

My collection of Alpine.JS components. I use Alpine.JS in my projects, and I'm always looking for ways to make my code more reusable. I decided to share my components with the community. I hope you find them useful. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please let me know by opening an issue or a pull request.

## Slide over

A slide over component that can be used to display a modal or a sidebar. It slides in from the bottom of the screen because the component was made for mobile devices. It can be used on desktop as well.
